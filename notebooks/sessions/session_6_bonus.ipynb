To make things a bit simpler, however, we will not really consider the evolutionary aspect here, only the reproductive one.\n",

    "## Understanding Controller routines\n",
    "\n",
    "We already saw how to implement and use routines for agents and objects, but we can also define routines that are not attached to specific entities. We call such routines *controller routines*. The routines of the controller are implemented and use in a very similar way as for entities. We define a controller routine as a Python function (similarly to entity routines we have seen before), but taking as argument the `controller` (instead of an agent or object as previously). The `controller.attach_routine` and `controller.detach_routine` methods manage its activation in the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use a controller routine to re-implement the eating mechanisms we used in previous sessions, enabling agents to \"eat\" resources when they are close to them. This is just for the sake of the exercice since we already saw a much more concise way to activate a pre-defined eating mechanism in session 3 (which behind the scene is actually implemented as a controller routine). \n",
    "\n",
    "An eating mechanism can be implemented in different ways, we will present one of them in the next cell. We start by defining the routine function, `example_eating_routine` here, with `controller` as an argument. Then, we iterate over the list of existing agents in order to make them \"eat\" resources next to them. At the level of one agent, we iterate over its list of eatable entities (`diet`). Then we check which entities corresponding to these types are existing and within the eating range of the agent, and we make them dissapear. Finally if an agent eats, we also reset its `time_since_feeding` to 0, and set its `ate` flag to True to signal he has eaten in the last simulation step.\n",
