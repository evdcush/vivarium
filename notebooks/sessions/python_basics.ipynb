    "The [`enumerate` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate) is used to iterate over a list and provide both the index and the value of each element. It returns an enumerate object, which can be converted to a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the index and the value of the corresponding element. Here, it enables to get the index of the entity in the list of eatable entities, as well as its index in the list of all entities in the simulation.\n",

We will create a list of the even numbers between 0 to 9 with a for loop, and then with a list comprehension. First to create the list with a for loop, we need to create an empty list, and then append the numbers between 0 and 9 if they are even. We can do it like this:"
